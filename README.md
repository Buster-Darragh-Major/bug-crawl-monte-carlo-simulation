# bug-crawl
This is a minor project started on a plane as a monte carlo simulation where I would place a 'bug' in the middle of a circle, and give a set distance it could travel every turn I would simulate the number of turns it would take on average to leave the circle with random direction changes every turn accross a range of distances.

Once I added a visual component I realized the neat visual potential this little project had, so I added toggleable color, line thickness, speed, etc. There are a tonne of parameters that can be played with to get a really different bunch of images! Enjoy some examples.
